# Game Development using OpenCV

## Introduction

This project focuses on the integration of machine vision technology, specifically OpenCV's Hand Tracking Module, into game development. Our aim was to explore the potential of using hand gestures captured by a webcam to control various aspects of games. Leveraging Python libraries such as pygame and cv zone, we developed four interactive games that respond to hand movements, creating a unique gaming experience.

## Abstract

Machine vision technology has a significant impact on the gaming industry, especially in the realms of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). VR headsets utilize cameras and sensors to track head movements, enhancing the player's immersive experience. In AR games, cameras and sensors overlay virtual elements onto the real-world surroundings. This project demonstrates how recognizing hand features through machine vision can elevate gaming interactivity and presents exciting possibilities for future game design.
